# Machine-Learning

This repository includes Machine Learning Projects done in CSE 417, Washington University in St. Louis

1. Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- Create a 11-dimensional, uniform, and randomized weight vectors and data set.
- Apply PLA on the dataset using randomly created vectors.
- Repeat the above for 1000 times.
- Analyze the number of iterations for each run, to be compared with calculated theoretical bounds.

2. Logistic Regression and Binary Classification Error
- Given data: Heart disease cases from Cleveland
- Initialize learning rate and maximum number of iterations.
- Utilize gradient descent to learn logistic regression model and binary classification model.
- Compare and anlyze each run in terms of different learning rate and maximum number of iterations

3. Random Forrest
- 

4. AdaBoost
